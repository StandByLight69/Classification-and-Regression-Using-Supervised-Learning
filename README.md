## Multinomial Logistic Regression

Multinomial logistic regression is an obsolete technique that was historically used to model the relationship between multiple input (independent) variables and a categorical output (dependent) variable with more than two possible classes. The dependent variable can take only a fixed set of discrete values, corresponding to the classes of the classification problem.

## Study Context and Motivation

As part of my university study, this model was implemented to critically examine the limitations of purely statistical induction when applied to human language. Human language exhibits ambiguity, contextual dependence, non-linearity, and long-range semantic structure, which directly challenge the simplifying assumptions of linear, feature-based models such as multinomial logistic regression.

To ground this analysis empirically, a large corpus of tweets collected over several years was used. This dataset is inherently noisy, highly variable, and strongly context-dependent. Factors such as evolving vocabulary, informal syntax, sarcasm, and domain drift further expose the reduced expressive power and limited generalisation capability of traditional statistical models when applied to large-scale language data.
